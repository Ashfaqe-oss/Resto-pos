demo Challenge


the installation and use is really simple as the code is condensed just into one server file named "index.js". And one html page just to render something on localhost. It has pre set and hard coded test case value. requests can be made via postman.
So, clone the repo and install the npm packages and u r good to go => start server with nodemon. 

Thank you.
